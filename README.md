# Paranoid

Paranoid is a [limited](#limitations) but fully rootless containerization tool. It allows unprivileged users on a system 
to create light-weight containers in which they can act as `root`.

It definitely should not be used for anything serious. That said, since it doesn't require any elevated privileges, the 
risk of escape is only as great as the user's rights outside of the container.

If you're feeling especially trusting, there are statically-linked, precompiled binaries available on 
[the releases page](https://github.com/anarchocurious/paranoid/releases).

## Usage

```
Usage: paranoid [OPTION...] --root=ROOT_PATH -- INIT [INIT_ARGS...]

  -h, --hostname=HOSTNAME    Set the hostname within the container
  -N, --disable-networking   Disable networking within the container
  -r, --root=ROOT_PATH       Set the root within the container
  -?, --help                 Give this help list
      --usage                Give a short usage message
  -V, --version              Print program version
```

  1. Extract [a rootfs tarball](https://us.images.linuxcontainers.org/images) somewhere on your system (you can safely 
  ignore any permission errors related to `mknod` -- `/dev` will mounted as `tmpfs` and populated during initialization 
  anyway).
  2. Run `paranoid --root=./path-to-extracted-root-fs -- /bin/sh -c "/bin/login -f root"` to get an 
  interactive shell as root inside the container.
  3. Profit!

**NOTE:** If networking does not seem to be working, make sure that the `eth0` interface is up, has the address 
`10.0.15.2`, is configured with the netmask `255.255.255.252` (`10.0.15.0/30`), and has `10.0.15.1` as a default gateway. You will also need to specify a DNS server in `/etc/resolv.conf`.

## Why?

Containers are awesome, but it seems paradoxical to me that I have to create them with a deamon running as root.

## How?

At a high-level, containers work with namespaces and anyone can create new namespaces. There are really only a couple of
snags with a totally rootless implementation:

  1. You can't map users that you can't act as into a new user namespace. This means that unprivileged users only get 
  one user inside of the container, themselves as root. This isn't a deal-breaker, but it is annoying and does cause 
  some compatibility issues with software that does not want to run as root.
   
  2. You can't communicate with the outside world from inside of an empty network namespace. The conventional way to 
  solve this problem is to create a bridge between the host network namespace and the container's network namespace,
  but this approach requires CAP_NET_ADMIN in the host namespace to create the adapter.
   
The issue with (1) is really that the kernel doesn't handle authentication. It doesn't know what -- if any -- additional
uids a user may be allowed to use just like it doesn't know that a user is allowed to update his password entry in 
`/etc/shadow`. This problem is solved by using the setuid helpers provided by the Shadow package on most distributions.

(2) is solved by creating a TAP adapter in the container's network namespace and running the raw ethernet frames through
a userspace networking stack which opens and manages the appropriate TCP/UDP sockets in the host network namespace 
(ICMP_ECHO support is achieved by running the setuid `ping` binary in the host namespace).

## Limitations

  * If you want to support multiple users inside of your containers, make sure that the `newuidmap` and `newgidmap` 
    helpers from shadow are available on your system and that your user has entries in `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`. 
    On Ubuntu, shadow is configured to create entries for every user in `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` by default, but 
    the `newuidmap` and `newgidmap` helpers are in the `uidmap` package which is not installed by default anymore. 
    
    **TL;DR:** Run `sudo apt install uidmap` on Ubuntu and friends if you want to have more than the root user inside of 
    your containers.
  
  * Systemd won't work as init inside of paranoid containers
  
  * There is no way to expose a port from the container on the host *(coming soon)*
  
  * There is no way to expose a folder from the host inside of the container

## Todos

  * Figure out how to get Systemd working
  
  * Add port exposure / port forwarding to the networking stack *(in progress)*
  
  * Add folder exposure / bind mounts
  
  * Add proper DHCP and DNS servers to the networking stack instead of pre-configuring the adapter in the container 

  * Add IPv6 support
  
  * Add sensible CLI interface and helpers for creating containers (extracting rootfs tars in usernamespace)

## Development

This project uses [cmake](https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/). You can probably get it building by running 
`cmake CMakeLists.txt` to generate the `Makefile`, then `make`.

An autotools-style configure script is also included for convenience.
